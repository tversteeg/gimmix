Gimmix will be installed to /usr/local/bin. If you want, you can change
the installation path by setting the --prefix argument to ./configure.

Note: gimmix stores its configuration settings in ~/.gimmixrc
The configuration file layout has been changed in the new version,
so, if you are upgrading from an older version of gimmix (0.1 or 0.2)
then make sure you delete your old .gimmixrc before starting gimmix.

README file.
